Welcome to the Tank Top TV APIs.  These are free to use for non-commercial use within reasonable usage limits, but please get in touch with us at <hello@tanktop.tv> if you'd like to use them for commercial purposes.

For more information about what you can do with these APIs please visit our [technology website](http://tanktoptv.com). To see our technology in action, or to find something great to watch, please check ut [Tank Top TV](http://tanktop.tv).

We're still in the process of documenting our APIs but please get in touch if you're interested in using an endpoint that is not fully written-up yet.

## API usage

You will need an API key to use the API.  To get one sign in to your [Tank Top account](http://tanktop.tv) then go to [Account -> Settings -> Apps](http://tanktop.tv/account/settings#apps) and create an app.  You will need to agree to our [terms of service](http://tanktop.tv/apiterms) and provide us with a little detail about what you are building.

The API is hosted at http://api.tanktop.tv.  Data is returned in JSON format.

If you have any problems please contact us at <hello@tanktop.tv>.
