## <a name="UserProfiles"></a> User Profiles

We support independent sets of user profiles for different services, one of which is the Tank Top TV service. Access to
retrieving information from or Tank Top TV user profiles is via OAuth.  Please let us know at <hello@tanktop.tv> if this is something you are interested in.

You can use our User profiles API to store user settings and details as JSON data.  User profiles are only visible to the service that creates them.  The service may provide their own user IDs (up to 32 characters).

|Endpoint | Function|
|:--|:--|
|`PUT /api/1/<apikey>/user/<userid>/` | create a user using your user id and set its initial profile|
|`POST /api/1/<apikey>/user/` | create a user, we'll choose the user id|
|`PATCH /api/1/<apikey>/user/<userid>/` | update an existing user profile|
|`POST /api/1/<apikey>/user/<userid>/` | update an existing user profile|
|`GET /api/1/<apikey>/user/<userid>/` | retrieve user profile|
|`DELETE /api/1/<apikey>/user/<userid>/` | deactivate a user|

Profiles are JSON and you can store pretty much anything you want (but please, no important personal information just yet).  Currently, the only restrictions are that the user ID is stored under the key 'id', and that top-level keys starting _ are reserved for our future use.

## <a name="UserActions"></a> User Actions and Events
This is for tracking events that take place on your system so that user actions can feed into personalized listings and recommendations, as well as into analytics tracking.


|Endpoint | Function|
|:--|:--|
|`POST /api/1/<apikey>/event/<userid>/<eventname>/<itemtype>/<itemid>/[<value>/]` | Create an event or add to a list |
|`DELETE /api/1/<apikey>/event/<userid>/<eventname>/<itemtype>/<itemid>/`| Delete an event or remove from a list|
|`GET /api/1/<apikey>/event/<userid>/<eventname>/<itemtype>/`| Get the items in a list, or for which an event has happened|


POST to add to a list, DELETE to remove, GET returns the items currently in a list.

Note that the userid does not have to be registered with Tank Top: you don't need to use the user profile API to make use of personalised lists or events.

### Parameters

The GET version accepts a single parameter **id** which can be repeated. This specifies the item ids you want to query.  Our expectation is
that you use events in the following manner.

1. You retrieve a list of movie or programme ids.  See [below](#PersonalizedLists) for how you can filter these by event so that you can, say, list only items on a watchlist, or exclude hidden or seen items.
2. You retrieve the meta data for these ids.
3. You get events for these ids, so that you can, for example, show the user's ratings for a show, or whether it is included in a watchlist.

### Event descriptions
The Tank Top system does not treat events with different names any differently (at present - we reserve the right to change this in future), but
we recommend you keep to the following meanings and event names.

| Event name | Description | Value |
|:--         |:--          |:--    |
| watchlist  | Items the user wants to watch | Not used |
| seen       | Items the user has seen | Not used |
| hide       | Items the user wants to strike out of lists | Not used |
| rated     | Items the user has rated | A numeric rating.  Use positive numbers for positive sentiments, negative numbers for negative sentiments |

### Examples
#### Request
Here we add movie 1 to user 7's watchlist.  There is no response.

``` POST http://api.tanktop.tv/api/1/<apikey>/event/7/watchlist/movie/1/ ```

#### Request
Here we ask if movies 1, 24 and 72 are in the user's watchlist.  1 and 24 are, 72 is not.

``` GET http://api.tanktop.tv/api/1/<apikey>/event/7/watchlist/movie/?id=1&id=24&id=72 ```

#### Response
```json
{
    "watchlist": {1:null, 24:null}
}
```

## <a name="PersonalizedLists"></a> Personalized Movie and TV lists

Get personalized listings for movie & TV shows.  This is the list of available shows on your services, not including seen or hidden items, taking into account your category preferences, and ordered according to goodness, recency, category balance - essentially this is the 'magic' personalized lists of things available to you, ordered according to what you might be most interested to watch.

|Endpoint | Function|
|:--|:--|
|`GET /api/1/<apikey>/list/<userid>/<itemtype>/`| Get the personalized item list for the user |

This is essentially an extension of [Listing Movies and TV](#ItemLists), adding a personalised dimension.  The URL is the same, with the _ replaced by a user ID.  We also have additional parameters to control how the list is filtered by events.

Note that the userid does not have to be registered with Tank Top: you don't need to use the user profile API to make use of personalised lists or events.

### Parameters

| Name       | Value  |
|:--         |:--     |
| filter     | An event name.  Include only items for which the user has registered an event of this name.  E.g. specify `filter=watchlist` to show the user's watchlist |
| exclude    | An event name.  Exclude items for which the user has registered an event of this name.  E.g. specify `exclude=seen&exclude=hide` to exclude items the user has seen or hidden |

## <a name="URLLookup"></a> Url lookup
Look up movies and TV episodes by the URL from a VOD provider website.

|Endpoint | Function|
|:--|:--|
|`GET /api/1/<apikey>/lookup/byurl/`| Look up an episode or movie by its url |

### Parameters

| Name      | Value  | Required |
|:--        |:--     |:--       |
|url        | The canonical URL for the episode or film | Yes |

So far we have tested this with BBC IPlayer, ITVPlayer, 4oD & Demand 5. Please read the notes on these below.

#### BBC IPlayer
Urls look like this http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b048zhsh/hardtalk-patrick-honohan-governor-central-bank-of-ireland.  The correct link is shown in the canonical `<link>` tag in the header of the IPlayer page for the episode (shown below). It does _not_ match the URL provided in the BBC RSS feeds or from the programme website (which is missing the slug).

```
<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b048zhsh/hardtalk-patrick-honohan-governor-central-bank-of-ireland">
```

You can use the following javascript within an episode page (i.e. as part of a browser extension or bookmarklet) to get the canonical URL.

```javascript
var url = document.evaluate("//link[@rel='canonical']/@href", document, null, XPathResult.STRING_TYPE, null).stringValue;
```

#### ITVPlayer
Please provide the link for an episode, not for a programme. For example https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/all-star-mr-and-mrs/series-6/episode-2, not https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/all-star-mr-and-mrs.

Note if you land on a programme page, the latest episode is highlighted.  To get the episode URL of the highlighted episode you can use javascript like the following.

```javascript
var episode = document.getElementsByClassName("node-episode episode-highlight")[0];
var url = document.location.protocol + '//' + document.location.host + episode.getAttribute('about');
```

#### 4oD
Episode URLs include a fragment identifier (a string following # at the end of the URL).  For example http://www.channel4.com/programmes/this-old-thing-the-vintage-clothes-show/4od#3720634. You need to include the fragment ID in requests to the Tank Top API.

On the 4oD site, links without fragments will refer to the latest available episode of the programme.E.g http://www.channel4.com/programmes/this-old-thing-the-vintage-clothes-show/4od currently shows series 1 episode 2 in a "hero" section at the top of the page, as well as highlighting it below in a list of available episodes.  In the list, the episode is represented by an li tag with class="episode-item item-data cf has-audio-describe selected".  The key classes are 'episode-item' and 'selected'.  We can use these classes to find the correct URL for the episode with the following javascript.

```javascript
var episode_li = document.getElementsByClassName("episode-item selected")[0];
var url = document.location.href + '#' + episode_li.dataset.assetid;
```

#### Demand 5
Please provide the link for an episode, not for a programme. For example: http://www.channel5.com/shows/thomas-and-friends/episodes/the-lion-of-sodor, not http://www.channel5.com/shows/thomas-and-friends.

Note if you land on the programme page, the latest episode is displayed in a box to the right of the screen.  You can find the url for this episode with the following javascript.

```javascript
var elt = document.getElementById('demand_episode_thumbnail');
var url = document.location.protocol + '//' + document.location.host + elt.children[0].getAttribute('href');
```

### Returned values
Tank Top represents movies by movie objects, and TV content by a hierachy of programme, series and episode objects.  To represent references to movies and TV on websites it has 'movie instance' objects, 'programme instance', 'series instance' and 'episode instance' objects. Instance objects link to the main object once their identity has been resolved, but can exist without links to the main objects if their identity has not been determined.

This API returns the instance objects the url refers to.  At present it looks for movie and episode instances, but in future it could be extended to include series and programme instances.  It allows for returning lists of instances in case a VOD site does not provide unique stable urls for individual items.

The JSON objects returned are as follows.

| Name       | Value  |
|:--         |:--     |
| episode_instances | A list of matching episode instances |
| movie_instances   | A list of matching movie instances |

The following fields are returned for episode instances.

| Name       | Value  |
|:--         |:--     |
| id | Tank Top ID for the instance |
| source_id | Tank Top ID for the source (i.e. for the VoD website) |
| series_instance_id | Tank Top ID for the series instance |
| programme_instance_id | Tank Top ID for the programme instance |
| programme_id | Tank Top ID for the programme. May be null|
| beamly_eid | Beamly episode ID if available |
| beamly_sid | Beamly series ID if available |
| beamly_bce | Beamly Broadcast Event ID if available |

The following fields are returned for movie instances

| Name       | Value  |
|:--         |:--     |
| id | Tank Top ID for the instance |
| source_id | Tank Top ID for the source (i.e. for the VoD website) |
| movie_id | Tank Top ID for the movie. May be null|
| beamly_eid | Beamly episode ID if available |
| beamly_sid | Beamly series ID if available |
| beamly_bce | Beamly Broadcast Event ID if available |

See https://develop.beamly.com/apis/guide/epg for details about Beamly identifiers.
